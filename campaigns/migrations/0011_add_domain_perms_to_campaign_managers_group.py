"""Grant view_domain + change_domain permissions to the 'Campaign Managers' group.

Mirrors the pattern from 0005_create_campaign_managers_group.py:
materialize permissions with create_permissions first (they don't exist
yet at migration-run time because post_migrate hasn't fired), then add
the two Domain perms to the existing group.
